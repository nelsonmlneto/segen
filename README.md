# Segen

Segen is a prototype of a testing tool that generates exacutable test scripts for Selenium and Selendroid from a higher level script.

It was developed as a final design for obtaining Computer Science bachelor's degree from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

Segen receives a single script written in Segen Language and generates two test scripts: one for Selenium and the other for Selendroid. With Segen, testers are able to write one single test script to test two equivalent versions of the same system. The generated Selenium script tests the web version and the generated Selendroid script tests the mobile version.
